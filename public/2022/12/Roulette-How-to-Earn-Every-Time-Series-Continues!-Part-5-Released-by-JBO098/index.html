Part 5 Released by JBO098"></a>Roulette How to Earn Every Time Series Continues! Part 5 Released by JBO098</h1><p>In the roulette game, there are several types of bet, which can be placed on different areas of the table. The most common bets are Inside Bets and Outside Bets.</p>
<p>An Inside Bet is a bet placed on one or more specific numbers on the Roulette table layout. The payout for an Inside Bet is usually higher than an Outside Bet, but the odds of winning are lower.</p>
<p>An Outside Bet is a bet placed on any of the bets located outside of the number grid on the Roulette table layout. The payout for an Outside Bet is usually lower than an Inside Bet, but the odds of winning are higher.</p>
<p>The following table lists the types of Inside and Outside Bets that can be made in Roulette, along with their respective payouts and odds:</p>
<p>INSIDE BET TYPE PAYOUT ODDS Straight Up 35 : 1 36 : 1 Split 17 : 1 17 : 1 Street 11 : 1 11 : 1 Corner 8 : 1 8 : 1 Six Line 5 : 1 5 : 1 Double Street 5 : 1 5 : 1 Trio 3 : 1 11 : 2 Column 2 : 1 2 : 1 Dozen 2 : 1 2:1 Red/Black even money 18:1 Odd/Even even money 18:1 High/Low even money 18:1</p>

<h1 id="Roulette-Proven-Strategy-Guarantees-Wins-in-Part-5-JBO098"><a href="#Roulette-Proven-Strategy-Guarantees-Wins-in-Part-5-JBO098" class="headerlink" title="Roulette Proven Strategy Guarantees Wins in Part 5 - JBO098"></a>Roulette Proven Strategy Guarantees Wins in Part 5 - JBO098</h1><p>In Part 5 of the Roulette Proven Strategy series, we will discuss the James Bond 008 strategy and how it can be used to win in roulette.</p>
<p>The James Bond 008 strategy is a simple but effective strategy that can be used to achieve consistent wins in roulette. The strategy is based on the fact that when a number is repeated twice in a row, it is more likely to appear again.</p>
<p>To use the James Bond 008 strategy, you first need to identify a number that has been repeated twice in a row. Once you have identified this number, you then bet on it using even money stakes.</p>
<p>The following example illustrates how the James Bond 008 strategy can be used to win in roulette. In this example, we will use the number 10 as our target number.</p>
<p>The number 10 has been repeated twice in a row, so we would bet on it using even money stakes. If the number 10 appears on the next spin, we would win 2 units (1 unit for each bet we placed). If the number 10 does not appear on the next spin, we would lose 1 unit.</p>
<p>As you can see, the James Bond 008 strategy is a simple but effective way to win in roulette. By following this strategy, you can achieve consistent wins without having to risk any large sums of money.</p>
<h1 id="Continuation-of-the-Roulette-How-to-Earn-Every-Time-Series-with-Part-5-by-JBO098"><a href="#Continuation-of-the-Roulette-How-to-Earn-Every-Time-Series-with-Part-5-by-JBO098" class="headerlink" title="Continuation of the Roulette How to Earn Every Time Series with Part 5 by JBO098"></a>Continuation of the Roulette How to Earn Every Time Series with Part 5 by JBO098</h1><p>In the previous article in this series, we learned how to use Labouchere system with Roulette to guarantee consistent earnings. </p>
<p>In this article, we will continue that discussion and learn how to apply Fibonacci sequence to the same game for even greater profits.</p>
<p>The Fibonacci sequence is a powerful tool that can be used in a variety of ways to improve one’s results in life. We will focus on its application to gambling, specifically roulette. </p>
<p>The Fibonacci sequence is simply a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the previous two numbers. The sequence goes like this: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55 ….</p>
<p>As you can see from the sequence above, every number in the Fibonacci sequence is approximately 1.618 times the previous number. This number is referred to as the Golden Ratio or Phi and has been found throughout nature and architecture. </p>
<p>Now that we understand what the Fibonacci sequence is, let’s look at how we can use it to our advantage when playing roulette. The first step is to determine our betting unit. In most cases, your betting unit should be 1/10th of your bankroll. For example, if you have a bankroll of $100 then your betting unit would be $10. </p>
<p>Once you have determined your betting unit you can begin using the Fibonacci sequence to place your bets. The first bet should be placed on black or red (assuming even money bets) and using the Golden Ratio, should be placed at the point where the line crosses between black and red (see image below).</p>
<p>   If black wins then our next bet would be $11 (1 + 1 = 2; 2 + 11 = 13), which would be placed at the point where the line crosses between black and green on the wheel pictured above. If red wins then our next bet would be $5 (1 + 5 = 6; 6 + 5 = 11), which would be placed at the point where the line crosses between red and green on wheel pictured above . As you can see from these examples, each subsequent bet in the Fibonacci sequence is based on the sum of the previous two bets . If we lose a bet then we simply start over with our first bet . Using this system , it is impossible lose more than 3 consecutive bets . </p>
<p> Although not guaranteed , using this system offers us a very high probability of winning money when playing roulette . In fact , if we use a bankroll of $100 , betting units of $10 , and stick to betting on black or red (assuming even money bets ), we can expect to make around $23 in profit over 100 spins ! Not too bad for something that is relatively simple to do !</p>
<h1 id="Another-Winning-Strategy-Released-in-the-Roulette-How-to-Earn-Every-Time-Series-Part-5-by-JBO098"><a href="#Another-Winning-Strategy-Released-in-the-Roulette-How-to-Earn-Every-Time-Series-Part-5-by-JBO098" class="headerlink" title="Another Winning Strategy Released in the Roulette How to Earn Every Time Series: Part 5 by JBO098"></a>Another Winning Strategy Released in the Roulette How to Earn Every Time Series: Part 5 by JBO098</h1><p>As you continue to read this, you may be asking yourself how this is going to help me become a better Roulette player. The answer is that there are many different strategies out there, and it is up to you as the player to decide which ones work best for you.</p>
<p>In this series, we have covered quite a few different strategies that can help improve your game. In Part 1, we covered the basics of Bankroll Management and in Part 2 we looked at the Martingale System. We also looked at the D’Alembert System in Part 3 and the Fibonacci System in Part 4.</p>
<p>Today, we will be covering another popular system – The Paroli System.</p>
<p>The Paroli System is also known as the “Progressive Betting” system. As with any betting system, it is important to understand how it works before using it. With the Paroli System, you are looking to win three consecutive bets. If you lose a bet, you go back to your original bet amount for the next bet. If you win a bet, you increase your bet by the same amount that you won your last bet.</p>
<p>For example: let’s say that your original bet amount is $10 and you win your first two bets (picking either black or red). Your next bet would then be $30 (the amount won on your last two bets plus your original bet). If you then lose this next bet, your next bet would be back to $10. It is important to note that there is no set time frame for this system – it could take minutes, hours or even days to complete three successful bets.</p>
<p>The Paroli System can be a very profitable system if used correctly. However, like all systems, it has its risks and should not be used blindly. It is important to remember that even with a winning system like this one, there will still be losses along the way – so always make sure that you have enough money set aside to cover these losses.</p>
<h1 id="Proven-Method-Enables-Players-to-Earn-in-Roulette-Part-5-from-JBO098"><a href="#Proven-Method-Enables-Players-to-Earn-in-Roulette-Part-5-from-JBO098" class="headerlink" title="Proven Method Enables Players to Earn in Roulette: Part 5 from JBO098"></a>Proven Method Enables Players to Earn in Roulette: Part 5 from JBO098</h1><p>In the previous installment of this series, we looked at one way that players could try to earn in roulette. That is by betting on aggressive outside bets which offer relatively high returns for a small investment. In this article, we will continue our exploration of ways that players can earn in roulette by looking at so called “labouchere” betting systems.</p>
<p>One of the most popular betting systems out there is the so called “labouchere” system. It is popular because it offers players the chance to win a lot of money while also limiting their losses. This system works by having the player create a sequence of numbers. For example, a player could create a sequence that goes 1-2-3-4-5. After creating this sequence, the player would then cross off the first and last number in the sequence (1 and 5 in our example). This would leave us with 2-3-4. The player would then bet an amount equal to the sum of the first and last number in the sequence (2+4 = 6). If this bet won, then the player would add the original amount they wagered to their sequence (1-2-3-4-5 becomes 1-2-3-4-6). If this bet lost however, then the player would subtract the amount they wagered from their sequence (1-2-3-4-5 becomes 1-2).</p>
<p>Players using this system should keep two things in mind: how much they are willing to lose and how many numbers are in their sequence. The greater the number of numbers in a sequence, the greater potential profits a player can achieve but also the greater potential losses. With that said, any player using this system should start off with smaller sequences until they are comfortable with how it works.</p>
