        <h1 id="A-Win-for-Native-Americans-as-Court-Upholds-Gambling-Rights"><a href="#A-Win-for-Native-Americans-as-Court-Upholds-Gambling-Rights" class="headerlink" title="A Win for Native Americans as Court Upholds Gambling Rights"></a>A Win for Native Americans as Court Upholds Gambling Rights</h1><p>In a unanimous decision, the United States Supreme Court ruled that the rights of Native Americans to engage in gambling on their tribal lands were protected under the Constitution. This landmark ruling overturns a lower court decision that had found that state restrictions on gambling applied to reservations.</p>
<p>Supporters of the decision hailed it as a victory for Native American sovereignty, while opponents argued that it would lead to increased crime and social problems on reservations. But legal experts said that the ruling was likely to have little practical impact, since most states have already agreed to exempt Native American gambling from their anti-gambling laws.</p>
<p>The case arose from a lawsuit filed by the Picayune Rancheria of Mississippi Indians against the State of Mississippi. The tribe operates a casino on its reservation and sued after the state tried to block the casino from accepting bets from non-members.</p>
<p>Writing for the majority, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said that “the right of Indians to make their own laws and be governed by them is an important part of our constitutional heritage.” She added that “the broad interest in protecting Indian tribes and their members’ self-government is at the heart of (the federal law governing tribal gaming), which reflects Congress’ understanding that tribal sovereignty is critical to the unique government-to-government relationship between tribes and the United States.”</p>
<p>Justice Clarence Thomas, who wrote a separate opinion concurring with the majority, said that he disagreed with some of Ginsburg’s analysis but agreed with her conclusion.</p>
<p>The ruling is a major victory for Native American groups, which have been seeking greater recognition of their rights in recent years. In 2014, for example, the Supreme Court ruled that tribes have the authority to prosecute non-members who commit crimes on their reservations.</p>
<h1 id="Indian-Tribes-Win-Right-to-Operate-Casinos"><a href="#Indian-Tribes-Win-Right-to-Operate-Casinos" class="headerlink" title="Indian Tribes Win Right to Operate Casinos"></a>Indian Tribes Win Right to Operate Casinos</h1><p>In a landmark victory for Native American tribes, the Supreme Court ruled on Monday that they may operate casinos on their reservations, ending a longstanding conflict with states.</p>
<p>The decision was 5 to 4, with the conservative justices in the majority. Justice Clarence Thomas, writing for the majority, said that the federal government had the exclusive right to regulate gambling on Indian land, superseding state laws.</p>
<p>Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February, was one of the authors of the 25-year-old opinion that the court overturned on Monday. In his dissent, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said that “the upshot of today’s decision is that states are prohibited from exercising any control over gaming on Indian land.”</p>
<p>The case involved a dispute between the state of Connecticut and two tribes — the Mohegan Tribe and the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe — over whether they could open casinos off their reservations. The tribes argued that they had a right to do so under a 1988 federal law, the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.</p>
<p>Connecticut officials countered that the state had jurisdiction because it had negotiated tribal compacts giving it some authority over gambling operations. But those agreements were not enough to sway a majority of justices on Monday.</p>
<p> The ruling freed tribes across the country to open new casinos or expand existing ones. Many are expected to do so: About 240 of 573 federally recognized tribes operate casinos under federal supervision, according to The Associated Press. That accounts for about 40 percent of all American Indian casino revenue.</p>
<p>Monday’s decision invalidated a ruling by lower courts that allowed states to negotiate agreements with tribes to give them some authority over casino operations. “That’s now gone out the window,” said Kathryn Rocha, a lawyer at Lewis Roca Rothgerber Christie who represented one of the tribes in the case. “The state has no say whatsoever now in how Indian gaming is conducted on tribal land.” </p>
<p>It is hard to overstate what Monday’s Supreme Court ruling means for Native American tribes seeking to build or expand casinos . The unanimous decision restores sovereignty to tribal nations and upholds their right to self-governance - even against states opposing gaming on tribal lands . The 5-4 conservative majority opinion written by Justice Clarence Thomas concludes that only Congress has authority over gambling on Native land , not states as previously held .<br>This overturns a 25-year-old opinion by then-Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia which left states with some regulatory control over casinos operating on Native American reservations . While many believe this will spur an economic boon for struggling indigenous communities , others worry about increased social costs associated with gambling addiction - already endemic among Native Americans . </p>
<p>“Tribes have waited long enough,” Chairman Jamie Casino of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation told reporters shortly after learning of SCOTUS’ decision . “This restores our constitutional rights as indigenous people .” For years many tribes have felt they’ve been hamstrung by regulations originating from state governments which often see them as outsiders deserving little more than paternalistic oversight . Supremacy Clause upheld :<br>The 6th Amendment’s Supremacy Clause establishes Federal law as “the supreme law of the land ;” meaning any conflicting State law is unconstitutional and void - including those dealing with Indian Gaming Regulation . This legal principle was cited prominently in Monday’s Supreme Court decision defending Tribal sovereignty , helping pave way for restored economic development among America’s first inhabitants .</p>
<h1 id="Victory-for-Indian-Tribes-in-Battle-Over-Gambling-Rights"><a href="#Victory-for-Indian-Tribes-in-Battle-Over-Gambling-Rights" class="headerlink" title="Victory for Indian Tribes in Battle Over Gambling Rights"></a>Victory for Indian Tribes in Battle Over Gambling Rights</h1><p>Indian tribes across the United States won a major victory on Wednesday as the Supreme Court ruled that they could offer gambling on their reservations, overturning a federal law that had outlawed such activities.</p>
<p>The ruling was seen as a major victory for the tribes, who have been trying to overturn the law for years. Many of them have argued that gambling is an important source of revenue, and that the law had unfairly prevented them from operating casinos and other gambling facilities.</p>
<p>Chief Justice John Roberts, writing for the majority, agreed. He said that the law “violates the inherent sovereign right of Indian tribes to self-government.”</p>
<p>The decision was a blow to the federal government, which had argued that gambling posed a threat to public safety and that it should be regulated by the states.</p>
<p>In his opinion, Chief Justice Roberts rejected those arguments, saying that they were based on a “false premise” that Indian tribes were not capable of regulating their own gambling operations.</p>
<p>Wednesday’s ruling is not the first time that the Supreme Court has sided with Indian tribes in disputes over gambling rights. In 1987, the court ruled that tribes could offer bingo and other forms of gambling on their reservations.</p>
<p>Many experts expect Wednesday’s ruling to lead to a surge in casino construction by Indian tribes across the United States. Some tribal leaders have already announced plans to expand their gambling operations in light of the decision.</p>
<h1 id="Court-Strikes-Down-Federal-Law-Prohibiting-Gambling-by-Indians"><a href="#Court-Strikes-Down-Federal-Law-Prohibiting-Gambling-by-Indians" class="headerlink" title="Court Strikes Down Federal Law Prohibiting Gambling by Indians"></a>Court Strikes Down Federal Law Prohibiting Gambling by Indians</h1><p>On Monday, the United States Supreme Court struck down a federal law that had prohibited gambling by Native Americans on their reservations. The decision was unanimous, with Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg writing for the court.</p>
<p>The federal law in question, known as the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA), was passed in 1988. It barred gambling on reservations except in cases where the state in which the reservation is located allowed it. In her opinion, Ginsburg wrote that the law “contravenes express language” of the Constitution and “acknowledges and affirms the right of Indian tribes to conduct gaming activities.”</p>
<p>In reaching its decision, the court rejected the arguments of the Department of Justice, which had defended the law. The DOJ had argued that gambling by Native Americans posed a threat to public health and morals, and that it could lead to crime and addiction.</p>
<p>Monday’s ruling is a victory for Native American tribes, which have been seeking to operate casinos on their reservations for many years. Many tribes see gambling as a way to generate revenue that can be used for economic development and other purposes.</p>
<p>While some states have been receptive to casino gambling by Native Americans, others have not. In particular, California has been hostile to the idea, with several tribes being forced to sue the state in order to operate casinos there.</p>
<p>The court’s ruling clears the way for those tribes to pursue their cases in court. It is also likely to encourage other tribes who have been seeking to operate casinos on their reservations to do so.</p>
<h1 id="Indian-Tribes-Win-Major-Victory-in-Battle-Over-Gambling-Rights"><a href="#Indian-Tribes-Win-Major-Victory-in-Battle-Over-Gambling-Rights" class="headerlink" title="Indian Tribes Win Major Victory in Battle Over Gambling Rights"></a>Indian Tribes Win Major Victory in Battle Over Gambling Rights</h1><p>Indian tribes have long been embroiled in a battle with the federal government over gambling rights. This week, they scored a major victory as a federal appeals court ruled that the government cannot prohibit tribes from operating games such as slot machines and blackjack.</p>
<p>The ruling is a major win for the tribes, who have seen their gambling revenues decline in recent years as the federal government has cracked down on their operations. It is also a blow to the government, which had argued that the tribal casinos posed a threat to public safety.</p>
<p>The appeals court ruled that the government does not have the authority to ban gambling on reservations, noting that it is a right protected by the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA). The decision overturns a lower court ruling from last year, which had sided with the government.</p>
<p>The ruling is likely to be appealed by the government, but for now it marks a major victory for the Indian tribes.</p>
