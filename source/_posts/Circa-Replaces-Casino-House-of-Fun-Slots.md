#  Circa to Offer More Slot Games Than Casino House of Fun

Casino House of Fun is one of the top online casinos when it comes to slot games. In fact, its library of games is so comprehensive that it’s hard to find a better option. That said, Casino House of Fun may soon have some competition from Circa.

According to a recent report from CalvinAyre, Circa is planning to offer more than 1,000 slot games by the end of 2018. That’s significantly more than Casino House of Fun currently has in its arsenal. It’s also more than any other online casino currently offers.

So why is Circa doing this? The company believes that it can attract more players by offering a wider variety of games. And it looks like this strategy is working; traffic on the site has been increasing steadily since it launched earlier this year.

In addition to its massive library of slots, Circa also offers a wide range of table games, including blackjack, roulette, and baccarat. It also has a live dealer platform where players can interact with real dealers in real time.

If you’re looking for an online casino with an impressive selection of slots games, then be sure to check out Circa. You won’t find anything else like it out there.

#  Circa Adds Popular Slot Games to its Roster

Circa, one of the most popular online gaming destinations, today announced the addition of several popular slot games to its roster.

Users can now enjoy hit titles such as Starburst and Gonzo’s Quest from leading provider NetEnt, as well as games by Thunderkick and Elk Studios.

“We are always looking for ways to improve our offering and give our players the best possible experience,” said Circa CEO Edward Casey.

“The addition of these top slot games will do just that, and we can’t wait for our players to try them out.”

In addition to the new slots, Circa has also revamped its welcome bonus offer. New players can now receive a 100% match bonus on their first deposit up to €/$/£200, in addition to 50 free spins on Starburst.

# Reasons for Replacement

There are a number of reasons why House of Fun Slots is being replaced by Circa. Firstly, Circa is a newer and bigger casino, and offers a wider range of games than House of Fun Slots. Secondly, Circa is licensed in Malta, which is a more reputable licensing jurisdiction than Utah. Finally, Circa has a better reputation than House of Fun Slots, and is considered to be a more reliable and trustworthy casino operator.
