#  What are the benefits of being a member of the Premier League? 

The English Premier League (EPL) is a professional football league in England and Wales. It was founded in 1992 as the FA Premier League. The league consists of 20 teams and operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the Football League.

As one of the world’s leading football leagues, the EPL offers clubs many benefits. These include significant financial rewards, high levels of exposure, and access to some of the best players in the world. Clubs that are successful in the EPL also enjoy a considerable amount of prestige.

One of the main benefits for clubs in the EPL is the financial rewards on offer. The league is one of the most lucrative in world football, with clubs earning significantly more than those in other leagues. In recent years, total revenue generated by the EPL has been in excess of £5 billion.

This money is distributed among clubs through a number of different channels. There is a broadcasting rights deal that sees UK broadcasters such as Sky and BT Sport pay over £3 billion per season to show matches live. This money is then shared between clubs depending on how often they are shown on TV. Clubs also receive money from commercial deals and Gate receipts (the money taken at matches).

The financial rewards available in the EPL have led to a number of clubs becoming extremely wealthy. The likes of Manchester City, Chelsea, and Liverpool have all benefited from being in the Premier League and now rank among some of the richest clubs in world football.

Clubs in the Premier League also enjoy high levels of exposure around the world. Matches are broadcast live in over 200 countries and this exposure helps to attract sponsors and commercial partners. This can be seen with brands such as Nike and Carlsberg who have long-standing deals with many Premier League clubs.

The quality of players in the Premier League is also very high. This is due to two factors: firstly, because it is one of the richest leagues in world football, top players are attracted to play here; secondly, because it is an extremely competitive league with only 20 places available each season. As a result, players are always fighting for their place in the starting XI and this creates a high level of competition for places on teams.

Being part of the Premier League brings with it a considerable amount of prestige for clubs. It is seen as one of the top leagues in world football and this can be seen by how much attention it receives from both fans and media alike. This notoriety can help clubs attract new supporters and commercial partners, which can be very beneficial financially speaking.
