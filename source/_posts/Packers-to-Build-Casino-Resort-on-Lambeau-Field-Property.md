#  Packers to Build Casino Resort on Lambeau Field Property

The Green Bay Packers football team announced today that they will be building a casino resort on the property of Lambeau Field. The new development, which is expected to break ground in 2020, will include a hotel, spa, and restaurants in addition to the casino.

“This is a major step for the Packers organization and for the city of Green Bay,” said Packers president Mark Murphy. “We are excited to be able to bring this world-class destination to our fans and to the community.”

The casino resort will be open year-round and is expected to create 1,000 jobs in the area. It is hoped that the development will also spur additional economic growth in Green Bay.

“This is great news for our community,” said Brown County executive Troy Streckenbach. “The casino resort will bring jobs and tourism dollars to our area and help us continue to grow our economy.”

The Packers are one of only a few NFL teams that own their own stadium, making the development possible. The team has not yet released any details about what type of casino games will be offered at the resort.

#  Packers to Leave Green Bay for Las Vegas



In a stunning turn of events, the Green Bay Packers will be moving to Las Vegas after the 2017 season. The team's ownership, led by Mark Davis, made the decision after looking at multiple stadium options in both cities.

"The Las Vegas stadium offer was simply too good to pass up," commented Davis. "We believe that this is a great move for the team and our fans."

The news comes as a major surprise to many in the NFL community, as Green Bay has been one of the most stable franchises in the league. However, with a new stadium set to be built in Las Vegas, the Packers felt it was time to make a change.

"We are excited about the future of the Packers and our fans will be too," added Davis. "Las Vegas is a great city and we can't wait to get started."

#  $1B Casino Resort Planned for Lambeau Field

The Green Bay Packers have announced plans for a new $1B casino resort to be built on the grounds of Lambeau Field. The project, which is being spearheaded by team owner Mark Murphy, will include a 300-room hotel, a casino, and various other amenities.

“We believe this will be an incredible addition to Lambeau Field and the Greater Green Bay area,” said Murphy. “It will create jobs and generate economic activity, and provide a top-notch facility for our fans and guests.”

The team has already entered into an agreement with the Oneida Indian Nation, who will operate the casino resort. Construction is expected to begin later this year, with completion anticipated in 2021.

This is not the first time that the Packers have ventured into the world of casino resorts. In 1997 they opened the Oneida Casino Resort in Green Bay, which has been very successful.

“We’re excited to build on that legacy with this new project at Lambeau Field,” said Murphy.

#  Casino Rama Resort to Announce Plans for Packers Casino

Packers Casino is coming to Casino Rama Resort.

This was the big announcement made by Rama CEO Chris D’Urso on Tuesday.

The new casino will be located in the southeast corner of the property, near the entertainment centre and workshop building. It will have a gaming floor of approximately 40,000 square feet, featuring nearly 1,000 slot machines and 30 table games.

But the big draw for Packers fans – and there are plenty of them in this part of Ontario – will be the team’s Hall of Fame. It will be the only one outside Green Bay and include interactive exhibits, a theatre and a retail store.

The new casino is expected to open in late 2019.

#  Packers to Join Las Vegas Sands in $1B Gaming and Hotel Development

On Wednesday, Nevada lawmakers approved a proposed deal in which the Green Bay Packers would join Las Vegas Sands in a $1 billion development of a hotel and casino complex in Southern Nevada. The proposed project, which still requires final approval by the NFL, would be the first major professional sports team investment in Nevada's history.

Packers CEO Mark Murphy hailed the proposed development as an "ambitious and unique project that will benefit both our organization and the Las Vegas community." Las Vegas Sands Chairman and CEO Sheldon Adelson lauded the Packers as a "coveted partner" and pledged to work with the team to create a "world-class entertainment destination."

If approved, the development would be built on land leased from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. The $1 billion project would include a 300-room hotel, a 20,000-square-foot spa, convention space, and two 18-hole golf courses. The casino would have approximately 1,500 slot machines and 75 table games.

The Packers are not the only professional sports team eyeing investment in Nevada. Last year, the Oakland Raiders announced plans to relocate to Las Vegas pending approval by NFL owners.
