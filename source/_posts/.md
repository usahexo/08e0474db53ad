The State of Streaming

With the rise of streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime, more and more people are choosing to forgo traditional cable TV subscriptions in favor of cheaper, à la carte streaming options. A survey conducted by Pew Research Center in early 2017 found that 15% of Americans had cut the cord on cable or satellite TV in favor of streaming services. While this number is still relatively small, it is indicative of a growing trend.

So what are people streaming? The answer varies depending on age group. For those 18-29 years old, the most popular streaming services are Netflix (87%), YouTube (85%), and Hulu (64%). For those 30-49 years old, the most popular services are Netflix (86%), Amazon Prime (62%), and YouTube (57%). And for those 50-64 years old, the most popular services are PBS/PBS Kids (54%), YouTube (48%), and Netflix (40%).

One thing that all age groups have in common is that they are watching less live TV. The Pew Research Center survey found that the percentage of Americans who watch live TV has fallen from 73% in 2005 to 47% in 2017. This decline is largely due to the growth of streaming services; people can now watch their favorite shows whenever they want, without having to tune into a specific channel at a specific time.

This shift away from live TV has implications for advertisers. Traditionally, advertisers have relied on Nielsen ratings to gauge the effectiveness of their ads. However, as more and more people switch to streaming services, Nielsen ratings are becoming increasingly irrelevant. Advertisers need to find new ways to measure the effectiveness of their ads, and they may need to start targeting specific streaming platforms rather than television networks.

The growth of streaming services is also having an impact on movie theaters. In 2017, domestic box office revenue was $11 billion, which was down 2% from 2016. One reason for this decline is that people are increasingly choosing to stream movies instead of going to the theater. As streaming services continue to grow in popularity, it is likely that movie theater attendance will continue to decline.

Despite these concerns, there is no doubt that streaming is here to stay. Growth in the streaming market has been strong over the past few years, and there is no indication that this trend will reverse anytime soon. Streaming offers a wide variety of content at a fraction of the cost of cable TV subscriptions, and it is quickly becoming the preferred way for people to watch TV shows and movies.

# Gambling on the island: Caribbean King of Cats Game a popular spot for betting

Located in the Eastern Caribbean Sea, the island of St. Kitts is a gambling hot spot for tourists and locals alike. Here you can find all sorts of games including slots, blackjack, roulette, and even cricket matches. One of the most popular attractions on the island is the King of Cats game, where players can bet on which feline will win a race around a makeshift track.

The origins of this wagering tradition are unknown, but it is thought to have been brought over by British sailors in the 1800s. The game has since become a staple at local pubs and betting parlors, with people risking everything from pocket change to entire paychecks on the outcome. The betting excitement is palpable as spectators cheer on their favorite feline while simultaneously trying to avoid being mauled by the cat's angry opponent.

There are typically several races run per night, with the final event taking place just before closing time. The stakes are high and some unfortunate souls have lost their homes as well as their dignity betting on these furry athletes. But for those who succeed in picking a winning cat, there is nothing quite like collecting your winnings and bragging about it to your friends back home.
