#  Learn about the toker poker and what it can do for you!

The toker poker is an interesting smoking device that has been around for a while but seems to be gaining in popularity. It is basically a small metal pipe with a screen on one end and a hole on the other. The smoker lights the herb on the screen and then sucking through the hole causes the smoke to be drawn into their lungs.

This type of smoking device is often used by people who want to avoid inhaling smoke from burning herb directly into their lungs. The toker poker allows them to smoke without having to hold the flame directly against the herb, therefore reducing the amount of carcinogens that they are inhaling.

The downside to using the toker poker is that it can be difficult to get a good draw on it. Some people find that they have to suck really hard in order to get any smoke, and this can be tiring after a while. Additionally, because it is small and handheld, it can be easy to lose track of it or misplace it.

Overall, the toker poker is a decent smoking device that can help smokers reduce their exposure to harmful carcinogens. However, it does have some drawbacks and may not be ideal for everyone.

When it comes to smoking out, there are a few different ways to do it. You can roll up some smokes, use a pipe, or just take a big ol’ hit from a bong. But for something different, why not try the toker poker?

What is the toker poker?

The toker poker is an interesting smoking device that looks like a small metal funnel. It has a hole on one side and a small chamber on the other. To use it, you put some weed in the small chamber, then light it and hold the hole on the side of the device close to your mouth. The flame from the weed will heat up the metal and create an airtight seal. This causes the smoke from the weed to be drawn into your lungs!

How does it compare to other methods of smoking?

The toker poker is definitely a unique way to smoke weed. It’s sort of like using a pipe, but instead of drawing the smoke through water, you’re drawing it through metal. This causes the smoke to be hotter and more concentrated. Some people find this makes for a more intense high, while others find it harsh and unpleasant.

Is it safe?

There is definitely some risk involved with using the toker poker. If you don’t hold the hole close enough to your mouth, you could end up breathing in hot ash or even starting a fire! Additionally, because the smoke is so concentrated, it can be more difficult on your lungs than traditional smoking methods.
