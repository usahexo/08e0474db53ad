Lightning Roulette is very similar to regular roulette. The only difference is that a lightning bolt occasionally zips across the wheel, changing the outcome of the game.

To play, simply choose your chip value and place your bets on the table just like you would in any other roulette game. The croupier will then spin the wheel and release the ball. The aim is to correctly predict where the ball will end up after it comes to a stop.

If you're lucky enough to see a lightning bolt fly across the wheel while the ball is in motion, you could win big! However, even if you don't get lucky with the bolt, there's still plenty of opportunities to win with this exciting new game. So why not give it a try at one of our recommended casinos?

# Lightning Roulette - A Game for Risk Takers!

Lightning roulette is an exciting game that can be enjoyed by risk takers of all levels of experience. The premise is simple - you place a bet on whether or not there will be a lightning strike during the next round of play. If you guess correctly, you win big!

The game can be played at home or in a casino, and offers the chance to win big payouts. In order to participate, you first need to place a bet. This can be done by betting on a single number or on a range of numbers. Once the bets are placed, the dealer begins dealing the cards.

When the game starts, all players must keep their hands above the table. The dealer then reveals one card at a time until either a lightning strike occurs or all the cards are revealed. If there is a lightning strike, the player who bet on that number wins! If there is not a lightning strike, the player with the highest value card wins.

One thing to keep in mind when playing this game is that you can only win if you have placed a bet on the number where the lightning strike occurred. If you did not bet on that number, then your payout will be zero. So, it pays to do your research and make sure you are placing your bets wisely!
