#  Russian poker players dominate at the World Series of Poker

The World Series of Poker (WSOP) is a yearly poker tournament held in Las Vegas. Players from all over the world compete for the coveted gold bracelet and a share of the millions of dollars in prize money. This year, Russian players dominated the tournament, taking home six of the 77 bracelets awarded.

One of the Russian victors was Vladimir Troyanovskiy, who won his first bracelet in a $1,500 No-Limit Hold’em event. “It feels amazing,” said Troyanovskiy after his win. “I feel so lucky that I was able to win this tournament.”

Other Russian winners included Ivan Luca (2 bracelets), Andrey Zaichenko (1 bracelet), Dmitry Yurasov (1bracelet), Artem Metalidi (1bracelet) and Mikhail Petrov (1bracelet).

Russia has long been known as a hotbed for talented poker players. In fact, Russia has produced more WSOP champions than any other country outside of the United States. This year’s performance is just further proof of Russia’s dominance in the world of poker.

#  Russian Federation ranks third in global online poker tournament winnings

Since online poker’s inception, Russian Federation players have been consistently among the top earners in the game. In 2017, Russian Federation players cashed in over $11 million in online tournaments, ranking third in the world, behind only the United States and Canada.

This impressive statistic is a reflection of Russia’s love for poker. The game is extremely popular in Russia, with an estimated 2 million players. Online poker tournaments offer a great opportunity for these players to compete against each other, as well as players from other countries.

The Russian Federation’s success in online poker tournaments can be attributed to a number of factors. First, the country has a large population of talented poker players. Second, Russian Federation lawmakers have been progressive in their approach to online poker, enacting laws that allow for legal and regulated online gaming. Finally, Russian players have embraced digital platforms for playing poker, using devices such as smartphones and laptops to access games.

The Russian Federation’s success in online poker tournaments is likely to continue in 2018 and beyond. Poker enthusiasts in Russia will continue to compete at the highest levels and help contribute to the country’s ranking as one of the world’s top online poker tournament winners.

#  Russian poker prodigy wins world's largest ever poker tournament

21-year-old Russian poker prodigy, Dmitry Yurasov, has won the world's largest ever poker tournament, taking home a staggering $10 million in prize money.

The tournament, which was held in the beautiful city of Macau in southern China, attracted over 2,000 players from all around the world. But it was Dmitry who emerged as the clear winner, beating some of the best poker players in the world.

"I am really happy right now," said Dmitry shortly after his victory. "This is by far my biggest win and I am so proud to have done it here in Macau."

Dmitry's remarkable victory is all the more impressive when you consider that he only started playing professionally two years ago. In that time, he has already won dozens of tournaments and established himself as one of the top poker players in the world.

Going into the final table of this year's Macau tournament, Dmitry was considered to be one of the favorites to win. Nevertheless, he had to face some of the toughest competition imaginable, including Phil Ivey – one of the most successful poker players in history.

In the end, it was Dmitry who triumphed, defeating Phil Ivey heads-up to take home first place. And with a payday of $10 million, he can now rightly claim to be one of the richest young men in Russia.

#  How to win at poker like the Russians

If you want to up your poker game and take tips from the Russian professionals, then look no further. This guide will show you how to win at poker like a pro – just like the Russians do!

1. Think Strategically

One of the key things that the Russians do so well when it comes to poker is that they think strategically. They don’t just play randomly or based on instinct; they plan their moves carefully and deliberately, always thinking about what their opponents might do and what the best course of action would be in any given situation.

This approach can be extremely successful, so make sure you always take the time to think about your strategy before playing – especially if you’re up against tougher opponents.

2. Use Poker Tells Wisely

The Russians are also experts at reading other players’ body language and using this information to their advantage. If you can start to pick up on some of the tells your opponents are giving away, you can use this knowledge to make better decisions during the game.

For example, if someone seems to be tense or is fidgeting a lot, they might be bluffing; alternatively, if someone is relaxed and calm, they could well have a good hand. Pay close attention to your opponents’ behavior and use this information to your advantage when making your next move.

3. Stay Calm under Pressure

One of the most important skills for any poker player is staying calm under pressure. The Russians are masters of this art – even when things aren’t going their way, they manage to stay cool and collected, never letting their emotions get the better of them. This level-headedness can often give them an edge over their opponents.

If you can learn to keep your cool under pressure too, you stand a much better chance of winning big pots and taking home that elusive victory. So stay calm and focused even when things are getting tense, and don’t let emotions rule your decision-making process.
